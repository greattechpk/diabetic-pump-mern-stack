# Diabetic-pump-mern-stack
**General Assembly ATL SEI-27 Project 4**
This is a mern stack project which takes in information used to deliver insulin for type 1 diabetics. The core functionality from this project allows for somone to make fake insulin deliveries based on a calcultor that takes in parameters set up in settings to make the correct calculations for the correct insulin amount.

## New Functionality 

Origionally this is based off of one of my older projects()

In this new version instead of Handlebars, ReactJS is used. Along with that an api is used to search food and add carb calculations along with having a nutrition totals section tracking fat protien and carbohydrate intake.

Edamum food database is the API used to provide food data.
